# April1 Lists and Strings

Q1. Write a Python program that defines a function `hasSymbol(myString)`, which checks if the given string contains any symbols like `!~|;:/><@`. The function should return `True` if any symbol is[...]

Q2. Write a Python function that counts the number of times each vowel appears in a given input string. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

**Requirements:**

Your function should be case-insensitive. This means it should count both uppercase and lowercase vowels (for example, 'A' and 'a' should be counted together).
The function should return the result as either a list or a dictionary.

**Example:**

If the input string is "Hello", the function should return [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] or { 'a': 0, 'e': 1, 'i': 0, 'o': 1, 'u': 0 }.

Q3. Given a Python list, write a program to remove all occurrences of the item `20`.

**Given:**
```python
list1 = [5, 20, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]
```

Q4. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
