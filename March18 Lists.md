# March18 Lists

Q1. Write a program that accepts the student’s name and an integer (student id) as inputs. Greet the user with the output “Welcome {name}”. Start counting up by 1’s from the student id that user entered. If the id is odd output “Special ID”. If the id is divisible by 5 output “Extra Special ID”. Once either message has been output 10 times, stop counting and display “Thankyou {name}” and then end the program.

Q2. Modify the program from Question 1 to add 3 lists to your program
1.	special_IDs_list for storing special IDs
2.	extra special IDs_list for storing extra special IDs
3.	important_IDs_list as a list of lists for storing special_IDs_list and extra_special_IDs_list
