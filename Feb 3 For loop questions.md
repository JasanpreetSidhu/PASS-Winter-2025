# Python Loops - Basic Understanding Questions

## 1. Conceptual Questions
1. What is the difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop in Python?
2. What will happen if the loop condition in a `while` loop is always `True`?
3. What is the purpose of the `break` statement in loops?
4. How does the `continue` statement affect loop execution?
5. What does the `range()` function do in a `for` loop?

## 2. Code Output Prediction
6. What will be the output of the following code?
   ```python
   for i in range(3):
       print("Hello")
   ```
7. What will be the output of this code?
   ```python
   i = 5
   while i > 0:
       print(i, end=" ")
       i -= 1
   ```
8. What will be the output of the following code?
   ```python
   for i in range(1, 6, 2):
       print(i)
   ```

## 3. Fix the Errors
9. Identify the error in the following code:
   ```python
   for i in range(5)
       print(i)
   ```
10. Identify and fix the error in this `while` loop:
    ```python
    x = 10
    while x >= 0
        print(x)
        x -= 1
    ```
